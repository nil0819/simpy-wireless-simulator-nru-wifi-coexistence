# Rashed-Step 7.A-08-05-2026-start
"""
Step 7.A: GenericWirelessDevice - a protocol-agnostic wireless node.

WHY THIS EXISTS
Every existing node type (wifi.WiFi, nru.Gnb, nr.GnbLicensedNR) bundles
raw PHY sense/transmit plumbing together with a specific MAC protocol
(CSMA/CA backoff for WiFi, Cat-3/4 LBT gap-based backoff for NR-U,
scheduled/always-on for licensed NR). Rashed asked (Step 7) for a
generic building block that separates the two: raw "sense the channel"
(sniffer) and raw "transmit a signal" primitives, with NO protocol
baked in, so it can become the base for several different future
things without duplicating the PHY plumbing each time:
  1. A spectrum analyzer / passive monitor (sniff() only, never
     transmits).
  2. An attacker/jammer base class (subclasses call transmit()
     however/whenever their attack logic decides, no CSMA/LBT in the
     way).
  3. A brand-new, custom-protocol node (subclass composes sniff() +
     transmit() into whatever MAC discipline it wants - including
     sense-before-transmit, if a subclass chooses to build that on top,
     the same way wifi.py/nru.py already do internally).

Confirmed with Rashed via AskUserQuestion:
  - Purpose: all three of the above - genuinely general-purpose, not
    narrowed to just one.
  - transmit() is UNRESTRICTED: it registers an ActiveTx on the shared
    channel the instant it's called, no built-in sense-before-transmit
    wait. Any channel-access discipline is layered on top by whoever
    calls it (e.g. a subclass could call is_channel_busy() in a loop
    before calling transmit(), but the base class itself never does).

DESIGN NOTES
  - Reuses the exact same shared primitives every existing technology
    already uses (channel.sensed_energy_dbm/is_busy/shadow_db/sinr_db,
    common_phy.rx_power_dbm/dist, common_phy.WaypointMobility) - a
    GenericWirelessDevice is a first-class citizen on the same channel
    model as WiFi/NR-U/NR, not a separate parallel system.
  - Airtime/transmission history is tracked LOCALLY on the device
    (self.tx_log), not added to channel.py's per-technology airtime
    dicts (airtime_data/airtime_data_NR/airtime_data_NRL). Those 3
    dicts are keyed to 3 fixed tech strings ("WiFi"/"NRU"/"NR");
    a generic device's tech_label is caller-defined and could be
    anything (many different attacker/analyzer/custom-protocol
    subclasses, each with its own label), so extending channel.py's
    schema again for this would mean growing it indefinitely. Local
    bookkeeping keeps this module 100% additive - zero changes to
    channel.py/wifi.py/nru.py/nr/nr.py to introduce it.
  - No MAC protocol, no receive/decode/ACK logic, no scheduler. Those
    are all left to subclasses (or later Step 7 sub-steps) to define,
    on top of the primitives here.

NOT YET DONE (future Step 7 sub-steps, per "one sub-step at a time" -
this file is only the core module + its own unit tests):
  - No spectrum-analyzer scenario/CLI built on top of this yet.
  - No attacker/jammer refactored to subclass this yet (existing
    attacker/*.py files are untouched).
  - No 3-way integration with WiFi/NR-U/NR in a shared scenario yet.
