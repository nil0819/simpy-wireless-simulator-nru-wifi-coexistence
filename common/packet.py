"""
Step 8.A: Packet - the shared, technology-agnostic unit of data this
simulator moves around, plus TrafficConfig - the knob that decides how
packets get created (saturated / poisson / cbr). See "Project details/
Step 8.txt" for the full rationale.

WHY THIS EXISTS
Until now, every technology's "thing being transmitted" (wifi.Frame,
nru.Transmission_NR, channel.ActiveTx) has been a technology-specific,
duration-and-diagnostics-only object - real enough to drive airtime/
SINR math, but with no persistent identity, no notion of a generic
"packet" a queue or a sniffer could reason about independent of which
technology sent it, and (for WiFi at least) already a fixed payload
size assumed to always be ready to send (the "saturated" traffic
model baked into Steps 5/6's validation work). Packet is the new,
shared layer underneath all of that: every technology's own
Frame/Transmission_NR/ActiveTx gets an optional `packet` field
pointing at one of these, so a Packet's identity/size/retry history/
delivery status is visible regardless of which technology carried it.

WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO YET
  - Packet.header_bytes is a plain int set by whoever constructs the
    Packet (wifi.py currently uses Times.mac_overhead//8, i.e. the
    same 40-byte MAC header size the PHY duration formula already
    assumes) - there's no per-technology header-size table here yet.
  - Nothing in this file computes on-air duration from a Packet's
    size - that wiring (Times.py taking a Packet's real size instead
    of a fixed config.data_size scalar) is explicitly deferred to a
    later Step 8 sub-step (8.C in the roadmap), to keep this one
    additive/non-behavior-changing.
  - No fragmentation/aggregation, no real payload bytes (content) -
    payload_bytes is a size only, matching this simulator's existing
    MAC/PHY-layer scope (not an application-layer simulator).

    """
    Real, citable QoE model for voice: a simplified form of the ITU-T
    G.107 E-model, specifically the closed-form delay/loss impairment
    formulas from Cole & Rosenbluth, "Voice over IP Performance
    Monitoring", ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 2001 - a
    widely used simplification of the full E-model for VoIP QoE
    estimation that needs only mean one-way delay and packet loss rate
    (both of which this simulator already tracks via
    compute_packet_stats()), not the full E-model's much larger
    parameter set (room noise, echo, talker levels, etc. - not modeled
    by this simulator's PHY/MAC layers at all).

    Id (delay impairment), Cole & Rosenbluth eq. for one-way delay d
    (ms), no echo term (this simulator has no echo path concept):
        Id = 0.024*d + 0.11*(d - 177.3) * H(d - 177.3)
    where H is the Heaviside step (0 for d <= 177.3, 1 otherwise) -
    delay under ~177ms has a small linear cost; beyond that, a much
    steeper additional penalty kicks in (this is the same "impairment
    accelerates past ~150-180ms" shape behind ITU-T G.114's 150ms
    voice budget already used in Step 10.C's QOS_LATENCY_BUDGET_US).

    Ie-eff (equipment impairment, codec + packet loss), same source,
    assuming G.711 (Ie=0 base codec impairment, Bpl=25.1 packet-loss
    robustness factor - G.711's own published constants, not tuned for
    this simulator):
        Ie_eff = Ie + (95 - Ie) * (Ppl / (Ppl + Bpl))
    where Ppl is packet loss AS A PERCENTAGE (0-100, not a 0-1 fraction).

    R = 93.2 - Id - Ie_eff (R0=93.2, Is=0, A=0 - the "best case" basic
    signal-to-noise term and no user-advantage bonus, matching the
    common simplified-E-model convention when only transport-layer
    delay/loss are being modeled, same as Cole & Rosenbluth's own
    worked examples).

    R-to-MOS conversion is the standard ITU-T G.107 formula:
        MOS = 1                                   if R < 0
        MOS = 4.5                                 if R > 100
        MOS = 1 + 0.035*R + R*(R-60)*(100-R)*7e-6  otherwise
    Verified against well-known reference points before use: R=93.2
    (zero delay, zero loss) -> MOS=4.409 (the commonly cited "G.711,
    no impairment" ceiling of ~4.4, not 5.0 - even a perfect network
    can't make G.711 sound like an in-person conversation); R=100 ->
    MOS=4.5 exactly (the formula's own ceiling).
