    if the simplified closed-form has no solution at this n/window (see
    model/bianchi.py's KNOWN LIMITATION) - this is a real answer ("the
    model doesn't apply here"), not a bug, so it's allowed to propagate
    rather than being swallowed into a wrong number.

    ap_cluster_radius: same rationale as compare_dtmc()'s - Bianchi
    assumes all n_stations share ONE collision domain, but without this,
    singleRun.py places all n_stations APs randomly across area_w x
    area_h, which for n_stations=5 already scatters them ~10-20m apart

    (cw_min=cw_max=Wo-1 on both technologies, matching the DTMC's own
    fixed-window assumption - see Project details/Step 6.D for why this
    matters: the simulator's DEFAULT exponential-backoff CW is NOT
    directly comparable to this model) and compares measured Cn/Cw
    (from the printed "Gnb/Wifi occupancy (Normalized)" lines) against
    dtmc.predict()'s Cn/Cw.

    wifi_packet_size_bytes: if given, passed straight to --wifi-packet-
    size-bytes so the simulator's actual Wi-Fi PPDU duration matches
    Twp_us (caller is responsible for picking a byte count that produces
    Twp_us via Times.get_ppdu_frame_time() - see model/compare.py's own
    __main__ block for a worked example using 36286 bytes = 5400us).

    ng: the paper's "number of mini-slots in a gap period" parameter -
    NOTE this does NOT simply equal sync_slot_us/sigma_us. This
    simulator's actual gap period (nru.py's wait_back_off_gap_after())
    waits a RANDOM amount until the next sync-slot boundary, uniformly
    distributed over [0, sync_slot_duration) - so its AVERAGE length is
    sync_slot_duration/2, and ng should be derived from THAT instead:
    ng ~= (sync_slot_us/2) / sigma_us. This was found (and this
    docstring written) after an earlier version of this function forced
    -syn_slot=500 to superficially match a leftover ng=55 assumption,
    silently changing the SIMULATOR's real behavior away from its actual
    1000us default rather than fixing ng to match that default - see
    Project details/Step pre_11.txt for the full story. The default
    ng=55 used throughout this project's Step 6.D/pre_11.C validation
    already matches the simulator's default 1000us sync slot correctly:
    (1000/2)/9 ~= 55.6 -> 55 - so leave sync_slot_us=None (the
    simulator's real default) whenever ng=55 is used; don't pass both.
    sync_slot_us: only pass this if you deliberately want the SIMULATOR
    itself to use a non-default sync slot - and if you do, recompute ng
    to match via the formula above, don't reuse ng=55.

    ap_cluster_radius: the DTMC model assumes all w Wi-Fi APs share ONE
    collision domain (every AP senses every other AP). singleRun.py's
    default random placement only fixes AP 1 at ap_pos - APs 2..w land
    randomly anywhere in area_w x area_h, so at higher w some pairs can
    end up outside each other's sensing range (a real hidden-terminal/
    spatial-reuse effect the DTMC doesn't model at all - discovered
    sweeping w=1..6, see Project details/Step pre_11.txt). Passing a
    cluster radius here places all w APs evenly around a circle of that
    radius centered on ap_pos instead of using singleRun.py's random
    fallback, keeping every AP within 2*ap_cluster_radius of every other
    AP so they stay mutually visible and the comparison stays valid.
    Leave as None to keep the old (w=1..4 only) random-placement
    behavior.
